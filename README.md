# Shopify Theme Inspector for Chrome

Profile and debug Liquid template on your Shopify store.

Shopify themes are fast out of the box, but Liquid changes made afterwards can cause slowdowns. Shopify Theme Inspector for Chrome helps identify Liquid changes that are slowing your site down by providing a visualization of Liquid render profiling data, and giving you the means to triage the slowest parts of your Shopify theme.

Documentation on how to use this extension is [available on shopify.dev](https://shopify.dev/docs/storefronts/themes/tools/theme-inspector/using-the-theme-inspector).
