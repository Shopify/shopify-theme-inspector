# Shopify DevTools

Devtool to profile and visualize liquid performance.

## Installing the extension
1. Install the [Shopify DevTools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/shopify-devtools/fndnankcflemoafdeboboehphmiijkgp) extension from the chrome webstore.
2. Now that the extension is added you should be able to see the Shopify icon in the toolbar of your browser.

### Extension Usage
1. Click the icon and then sign in to authenticate yourself as an admin or staff of the Shopify store.
2. Once you are authenticated you should be able to open the chrome developers console using `command(⌘) + shift + C` on a mac and `control + shift + J` for windows keyboards.
3. Navigate to the Shopify panel which should be visible in the same top bar as `Console` and `Network`. If it is not visible click the `>>` icon to the right of the panel names and select Shopify.
4. Click the load profile button to view the flamegraph. Click [here](http://www.brendangregg.com/FlameGraphs/cpuflamegraphs.html#Description) for more contexts on flamegraphs and how to read them.

The Shopify Devtool tab will only show up when you're on your Shopify store.
If you see an error saying `This page cannot be profiled` it may be because:
1. You are not currently on a Shopify store.
2. The checkout flow is not meant to be profiled using this extension.
